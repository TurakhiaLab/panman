Node:
   Nuc_Mut has four attributes:
   1. position: mutation co-ordinate
   2. gap_position: mutation gap co-ordinate w.r.t. position
   3. condensed: it has 3 (or 4) sub-attributes
      Note: Depending upon type of mutation, sub-attributes changes
      if (Non-SNP):
         a. block-id (3B)
         b. length of contiguous mutation (5 bits)
         c. type of mutation (3 bits)
      else :
         a. block-id (3B)
         b. length of contiguous mutation (1 bits)
         c. mutation character (4 bits)
         d. type of mutation (3 bits)
   4. nucs: list of mutation characters. Each character is represented by 4 bits (One-hot encoding), therefore maximum 8 characters can be stored.
      Note: We do not need to store mutations character list in case of deletions

   block_mut has one attribute, condensed_block_mut, which has two sub-attributes:
         a. block-id (3B)
         b. type of mutation (3 bits)

Gap list:
   It has 3 attributes:
   1. position: gap co-ordinate
   2. block-id: (3B -> Stored in int32)
   b. length of contiguous gaps (4B)
      
Block list: (Currently not used)
   It has 2 attributes:
   1. blockid: List of block ids
   2. chromosome_name: List of chromosome name associated with corresponding blocks


Type of mutations:
SUBS    =   "000"
DEL     =   "001"
INS     =   "010"
SUBS1   =   "011"
INS1    =   "100"
DEL1    =   "101"

newick: Stores the newick tree
node:

      4. blockId: unique block identifier (4B for global co-ordinate and 4B for co-ordinate witin a gap)
      5. blockGapExist: whether gap exist or not inn block list
      6. mutInfo: it has 3 sub-attributes
         a. type of mutation (4 bits)
         b. length of contiguous mutation (4 bits)
         b. mutated nucleotides (24 bits)
