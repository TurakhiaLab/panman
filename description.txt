Mutations has four attributes:
1. position: mutation co-ordinate
2. gap_position: mutation gap co-ordinate w.r.t. position
3. condensed: it has 3 (or 4) sub-attributes
   Note: Depending upon type of mutation, sub-attributes changes
   if (type of mutation: S, D, I: 00, 01, 10):
      a. block-id (3B)
      b. length of contiguous mutation (6 bits)
      c. type of mutation (2 bits)
   else (type of mutaion: SNP: 11):
      a. block-id (3B)
      b. length of contiguous mutation (2 bits)
      c. mutation character (4 bits)
      d. type of mutation (2 bits)
4. mutated_chars: list of mutation characters. Each character is represented by 4 bits (One-hot encoding), therefore maximum 8 characters can be stored.
   Note: We do not need to store mutations character list in case of deletions

Blocks: List of blocks at a particular node after applying Fitch's Sankoff algorithm
