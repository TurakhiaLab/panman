newick: Stores the newick tree
node:
   a) nucMut has following attributes:
      1. nucPosition: mutation co-ordinate
      2. nucGapPosition: mutation gap co-ordinate w.r.t. position
      3. nucGapExist: whether gap exist or not in nucleotide list 
      4. blockId: unique block identifier (4B for global co-ordinate and 4B for co-ordinate witin a gap)
