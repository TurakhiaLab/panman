Node:
   Nuc_Mut has four attributes:
   1. position: mutation co-ordinate
   2. gap_position: mutation gap co-ordinate w.r.t. position
   3. condensed: it has 3 (or 4) sub-attributes
      Note: Depending upon type of mutation, sub-attributes changes
      if (type of mutation: S, D, I: 00, 01, 10):
         a. block-id (3B)
         b. length of contiguous mutation (6 bits)
         c. type of mutation (2 bits)
      else (type of mutaion: SNP: 11):
         a. block-id (3B)
         b. length of contiguous mutation (2 bits)
         c. mutation character (4 bits)
         d. type of mutation (2 bits)
   4. nucs: list of mutation characters. Each character is represented by 4 bits (One-hot encoding), therefore maximum 8 characters can be stored.
      Note: We do not need to store mutations character list in case of deletions

   block_mut has one attribute, condensed_block_mut, which has two sub-attributes:
         a. block-id (3B)
         b. type of mutation (2 bits)

Gap list:
   It has 2 attributes:
   1. position: gap co-ordinate
   2. condensed: it has 2 sub-attributes
      a. block-id (3B)
      b. length of contiguous gaps (1B)
      
Block list: (Currently not used)
   It has 2 attributes:
   1. blockid: List of block ids
   2. chromosome_name: List of chromosome name associated with corresponding blocks
